## Introduction

AutoCommit is a handy command-line tool that simplifies the git commit process by automatically generating meaningful commit messages using AI. Leveraging powerful language models like those from OpenAI, Groq, and other open-source providers, AutoCommit takes into account the changes made to the codebase and produces concise, descriptive commit messages that reflect the purpose and nature of those changes.

Git commits are an integral part of the software development process. However, crafting meaningful commit messages can sometimes be a time-consuming and even a daunting task. AutoCommit is designed to ease this process and help developers maintain a clean commit history without the overhead of thinking about commit messages for each and every change.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Commit Messages**: AutoCommit uses powerful language models to generate commit messages that are concise and meaningful.
- **Interactive CLI**: The tool comes with an interactive command-line interface that guides you through the commit process.
- **Customizable**: Customize the level of verbosity and other settings to suit your preferences.
- **Clipboard Integration**: Easily copy generated commit messages to the clipboard.
- **Completion Scripts**: AutoCommit comes with completion scripts for Bash, Zsh, Fish, and PowerShell.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/christian-gama/autocommit.git
   cd autocommit
   ```

2. Build the application (Make sure you have Go installed):

   ```shell
   make build
   ```

3. Install the application (Linux/macOS):

   ```shell
   make install
   ```

4. Add completion to your shell (Optional):

   Fish:

   ```shell
   autocommit completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/autocommit.fish
   exec fish
   ```

   Bash:

   ```shell
   autocommit completion bash | sudo tee /etc/bash_completion.d/autocommit > /dev/null
   exec bash
   ```

   Zsh:

   ```shell
   mkdir -p ~/.zsh/completions
   autocommit completion zsh > ~/.zsh/completions/_autocommit
   echo 'fpath=(~/.zsh/completions $fpath)' >> ~/.zshrc
   echo 'autoload -Uz compinit && compinit' >> ~/.zshrc
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

   PowerShell:

   ```shell
   autocommit completion powershell > autocommit.ps1
   # Then source autocommit.ps1 in your PowerShell profile
   ```

## Configuration

AutoCommit supports multiple language model providers for generating commit messages, including OpenAI, Groq, and free open-source models. Depending on your chosen provider, you may need an API key. For example, you can get an OpenAI API key from [OpenAI's website](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and a Groq API key from [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/keys).

Once you have the necessary credentials (if required), run the `autocommit` command. On the first run, AutoCommit will prompt you to configure your preferred provider, model, and temperature. These settings are stored locally for future use.

## Usage

1. Change to your git repository.
2. Make the changes in your repository that you want to commit.
3. Stage the changes.
4. Run the AutoCommit tool:

   ```text
   Autocommit is a CLI tool that uses AI language models (like OpenAI, Groq models and others) to generate commit messages based on the changes made in the repository.

   Usage:
   autocommit [flags]
   autocommit [command]

   Available Commands:
   completion  Generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell
   help        Help about any command
   reset       Reset the configuration file
   set         Set configuration configs

   Flags:
   -h, --help   help for autocommit

   Use "autocommit [command] --help" for more information about a command.
   ```

5. Follow the interactive command-line interface. Choose whether to commit changes to git, generate a new commit message, copy the commit message to the clipboard, or exit the tool.
6. If you select the commit option, the tool will use the generated message to make a git commit.

## Customization

AutoCommit provides you with a unique command called `autocommit edit` that allows you to customize the default instructions given to the AI. With this feature, you can tailor AutoCommit's behavior to better match your workflow and style.

### Usage

Simply run `autocommit edit` in your terminal to open up the current instruction set in your default text editor.

```shell
autocommit edit
```

After making your changes, save and exit the editor. AutoCommit will now use your updated instructions when generating commit messages. This allows you to adjust the level of detail, tone, and style of the generated commit messages.

Please note that if the instruction file is deleted or found to be empty, AutoCommit will automatically recreate it with the default instructions.

## About Conventional Commits

AutoCommit generates commit messages that follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification. It is a good practice to make small, incremental commits that are easy to understand and follow. If you're trying to make a commit that contains multiple changes, consider splitting it into multiple commits - it will make your commit history much cleaner and helps the AI generate better commit messages.

## Known Issues

- The tool currently only supports english generated messages.
- Some models (e.g., GPT-3.5) may occasionally ignore instructions..
- Commits with a lot of changes may produce a less accurate or meaningless commit message.
